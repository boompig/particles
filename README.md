Particle Generator
=========

This is a particle generator which poorly simulates blackbody radiation and the movement of stars around massive black holes. 

It attempts to model star lifecycles by aging stars. The 'energy' field is intended to model something like 'fissile material available',
and dictates temperature. I'm not really sure how red giants and white/blue dwarfs are formed, so I more or less guessed.

As I do more astronomy reading, this simulation will come more into line with what is acceptable in terms of star variables.

This simulation ignores star interactions with each other, but it does have statically placed black holes, to create non-linear motion.

I am not sure how stars are 'formed', so I just have nebulae spawn stars of varrying energies and with a fixed velocity.
